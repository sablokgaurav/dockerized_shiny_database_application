# shiny_database_application
a shiny database application that uses sqlite3 and provides an interface to the web semantics for the analysis of the transcriptomics and expression datasets. this is a templated version and you can put as many templates sub parts for the visualization. it uses networkx as a backhand and gives the cummulative information for the transcriptomics and gene expression datasets.

I finally added the support for the docker before pushing the main code so that it can be dockerzied and also added a general template which can be used for the expression analysis.
